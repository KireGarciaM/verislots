A Slot Machine Simulation for the NexysA7 50t written in Verilog

## Setup and Testing
I personally prefer **Xilinx's Vivado** from https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html to compile and test Verilog on Vivado. 

Xilinx has great video setup guides incase you need them: https://www.xilinx.com/video/hardware/getting-started-with-the-vivado-ide.html

## Contributing
If any issues are found make sure to put them in the issues section, fork the branch, and setup locally.

If you have any ideas for enhancements or bugs, create a new issue for approval.

For issues I would apreciate a Title and short description with good details about said issue, alog with which board is being used
if not using the Nexys A7-50t.

When you're finished with an issue, you can open up a pull requests and a review will take place before any merges.

## Coding
Anything works as long as the code is:
  - written in Verilog
  - organized and consistent
